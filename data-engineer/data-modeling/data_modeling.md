- Database: is a structured repository or collection of data that is stored and retrieved electronically for use in applications. Data can be stored, updated, or deleted from a database.
- Data modeling (DM) is about how to structure data to be used by different people within an organization.
  - Data engineers continually reorganize, restructure, and optimize data models to fit the needs of the organization.
  - Process to support business and user applications --> gather requirements --> conceptual data modeling --> logical DM --> physical DM
- Advantages of using a Relational Database:
  - Ease of use SQL, ability to do JOINS
  - Ability to do aggregations and analytics
  - Smaller data volumes
  - Easier to change business requirements
  - Secondary Indexes available
  - ACID Transactions, data integrity: guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures.
    - Atomicity: the whole transaction is processed, or nothing is processed.
    - Consistency: only transactions that abide by constraints and rules are written into the database. The data should be correct across all rows and tables.
    - Isolation: transactions are processed independently and securely, order does not matter.
    - Durability: completed transactions are saved to database even in cases of system failure.
- When NOT to use a Relational Database
  - Large amounts of data: not distributed databases and only scale vertically by adding more storage in machine.
  - RDs are not designed to handle unstructured data.
  - While ACID transactions bring benefits, they also slow down the process of reading and writing data.
  - Flexible schema
  - High availability and horizontal scalability.
